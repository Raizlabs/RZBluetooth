/**
 * RZBEnableMock swizzles [CBCentralManager alloc] and [CBPeripheralManager alloc] 
 * so consumers of Core Bluetooth can use the mocked objects without injecting them
 * in the consumer side. Once RZBEnableMock(YES) is called, the object returned by
 * [CBCentralManager alloc] will conform to RZBMockedCentralManager, and the object
 * returned by [CBPeripheralManager alloc] will conform to RZBMockedPeripheralManager.
 *
 * I know this sounds terrifying but it works great.
